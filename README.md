# Hoytdj's Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket Bot
This bot is an extension (AKA fork) of [Arturo's PTCGP Bot](https://github.com/Arturo-1212/PTCGPB). _Thanks for all the hard work Arturo!_ After any new releases of the main bot, this bot will be updated as soon as possible.

Check the wiki for instructions on how to install: https://github.com/Arturo-1212/PTCGPB/wiki/Pokemon-TCG-Pocket-Bot

**IMPORTANT:** Tesseract OCR is required for this to work.
* Download/install Tesseract OCR from here: [Tesseract OCR Github Link](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) 
* I recommend you install Tesseract OCR under `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`. If you install it elsewhere, you **must** manually open your `Settings.ini` file and add the full path to your Tesseract executable. For example: `tesseractPath=C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe`

### What features does this add?
A new "**GP Test**" mode has been added to the Main account script. When toggled on, the bot will automatically remove all non-VIP friends (i.e., friends that may have pulled a live GP). When all non-VIP friends have been removed, the bot will pause, giving you the opportunity to nagivate to Wonder Picks and look for God Packs. When you're ready to continue, simply toggle "**GP Test**" mode off.
VIP friends are specified in the `vip_ids.txt` file. List friend codes each on their own line.

#### Why would you want this?
**Managing your friend list is as easy as one click!** The bot will automatically take care of removing dead accounts, dud accounts, or simply accounts that just haven't finished rolling.

- A new setting "**VIP ID URL**" has been added. You can add specify a downloadable text file for your `vip_ids.txt` file (just like you can for ids.txt)
 `vip_ids.txt` also supports FC, IGN, and star count. Including the IGN can improve account matching accuracy. Including the star count will apply additional filtering. For example, if your min 2 star setting is 3, accounts with a GP not meeting the minimum will be ignored (not counted as a VIP).

Example file contents:
```
0735520049083732 | Nate0562 | 0/5
8076495483324199 | CheryS6334 | 3/5
2666277563052062 | CCdarumaka | 3/5

## Bonus features:
* _Rayer_3's Scale100_ - Adds support for 100% scale in addition to the standard 125% scale.
* _DietPepperPhD's 5 Pack Method_ - The "5 Pack No Remove" method skips the remove/add friends step between the 3rd and 4th pack. This means you may have to test 5P GPs, but your effective packs per minute will be faster.
* New Heartbeat **Delay** option. Use this option to send heartbeat messages more or less frequently. _You should not reduce this below your average rerolling run time._
* New "**Send Account XML**" option. When enabled the Discord alert message for found packs will attach the account XML file. *I recommend enabling this option if you are using "5 Pack No Remove" and rolling in a group, so that others can inject the account to check for WP Thanks.*

_A note from Arturo (which I echo):_

_The bot will always be free and I will update it as long as this method is viable. I've spent many hours creating the PTCGPB, and if itâ€™s helped you complete your collection, consider buying me a coffee to keep me going and adding new features!_
